    " - Consulting web pages that may have a solution to a given homework problem or one similar is cheating.  However, consulting the class notes, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the homework problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course notes, the course textbook, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",

    "**1.1:** One way that scientists are misusing p-values is that they believe p-values prove your hypothesis. This is not true. Instead, p-value is the probability of getting the data you observed based on your hypothesis. Another way that scientists are misuing p-values is that it tells you the probabilty of the results being true. Finally, scientists were misusing p-values to separate false findings from true findings by cherry picking their p-value to fit their data. \n",

Thus, the minimum number of tests you need to do before it's more than 50% likely that at least one of the tests will incorrectly reject the null is 13 tests. This is because the probability of having none of the 14 tests come up significant is $0.95^{14}=.4877$ and $(1-.4877)*100=51.23%$ of the time one or more of the tests will reject the null by chance.\n",

By random chance, a fair die won't always result in equal proportions (that is, we won't get exactly 1,000 of each face). However, if we suspect that the die might be unfair based on the data, we can conduct a hypothesis test using TVD to compare the expected [$\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$] distribution to what is actually observed.\n",

    "## Question 4: Deflategate\n",
    "\n",
    "On January 18, 2015, the Indianapolis Colts and the New England Patriots played the American Football Conference (AFC) championship game to determine which of those teams would play in the Super Bowl. After the game, there were allegations that the Patriots' footballs had not been inflated as much as the regulations required; they were softer. This could be an advantage, as softer balls might be easier to catch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For several weeks, the world of American football was consumed by accusations, denials, theories, and suspicions: the press labeled the topic Deflategate, after the Watergate political scandal of the 1970's. The National Football League (NFL) commissioned an independent analysis. In this example, we will perform our own analysis of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pressure is often measured in pounds per square inch (psi). NFL rules stipulate that game balls must be inflated to have pressures in the range 12.5 psi and 13.5 psi. Each team plays with 12 balls. Teams have the responsibility of maintaining the pressure in their own footballs, but game officials inspect the balls. Before the start of the AFC game, all the Patriots' balls were at about 12.5 psi. Most of the Colts' balls were at about 13.0 psi. However, these pre-game data were not recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the second quarter, the Colts intercepted a Patriots ball. On the sidelines, they measured the pressure of the ball and determined that it was below the 12.5 psi threshold. Promptly, they informed officials. \n",
    "\n",
    "At half-time, all the game balls were collected for inspection. Two officials, Clete Blakeman and Dyrol Prioleau, measured the pressure in each of the balls. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the data. Each row corresponds to one football. Pressure is measured in psi. The Patriots ball that had been intercepted by the Colts was not inspected at half-time. Nor were most of the Colts' balls – the officials simply ran out of time and had to relinquish the balls for the start of second half play."

    "“The average pressure drop of the Patriots game balls exceeded the average pressure drop of the Colts balls by 0.45 to 1.02 psi, depending on various possible assumptions regarding the gauges used, and assuming an initial pressure of 12.5 psi for the Patriots balls and 13.0 for the Colts balls.”  (Investigative report commissioned by the NFL regarding the AFC Championship game on January 18, 2015)\n",

    "Our analysis shows an average pressure drop of about 0.73 psi, which is close to the center of the interval “0.45 to 1.02 psi” and therefore consistent with the official analysis.\n",
